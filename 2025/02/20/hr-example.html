  <h1>Where Are My Pointers? : Ditching C++98</h1>

  <p>When i did the IRC server, I had no choice but to use C++98. That’s just how things are at my university, i remember a friend telling me that C++11 was almost a different language, he was right.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-upgraded-to-c20">Why I Upgraded to C++20</h2>

<p>The most obvious change I made was getting rid of all the naked pointers. Back in the original version, everything was manually allocated and deallocated using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delete</code>, which not only made memory management more tedious but also increased the risk of leaks and dangling pointers.</p>

<p>Now, everything is managed using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::shared_ptr</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::unique_ptr</code>, which ensures proper ownership and automatic cleanup.</p>

<p>Before :</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">clients_</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Client</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After :</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">clients_</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">make_shared</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Client</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Besides this, I also used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enable_shared_from_this</code> to handle shared ownership more safely when dealing with channels:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Channel</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">enable_shared_from_this</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Channel</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="learning-auto-and-other-modern-c-features">Learning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auto</code> and Other Modern C++ Features</h2>

<p>Another big thing I learned while doing this refactor was how to properly use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auto</code>. It might seem trivial, but coming from C++98, where everything had to be explicitly typed, it felt like magic.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">vector</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Client</span><span class="o">*&gt;::</span><span class="n">iterator</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">clients</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">clients</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not only does it make the code look cleaner, but it also saves time and avoids unnecessary verbosity.</p>

<h2 id="if-i-had-started-in-c20-from-scratch">If I Had Started in C++20 From Scratch…</h2>

<p>This project was originally designed with my C++98 brain, so even though I modernized it, there are still structural decisions that don’t fully take advantage of what C++20 offers. If I had started this project from scratch knowing modern C++, I probably would have structured it completely differently.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The structure and handling of the channel pointers would be different</li>
  <li>I would have leveraged <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::variant</code> instead of relying on error-prone null checks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Refactoring this project was a fun learning experience, and while it still retains most of its C++98 roots, it’s now much more efficient, safer, and easier to maintain.</p>
